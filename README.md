# AWS-RDS-Manipulating-Data


This project was created by setting the MySQL instance on AWS, connecting to MySQL Workbench on my personal computer, creating the database schemas, then created the four 
tables with data, Customers, Employees, Managers, Manager_Employee. 

I was able to add the manager name for the employees from the Manager_Employee table.
