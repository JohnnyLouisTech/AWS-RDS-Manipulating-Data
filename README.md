# AWS-RDS-Manipulating-Data


This project was created on by setting the MySQL instance on AWS, connect to MySQL Workbench on my personal computer, created the database schemas, then ceated the four 
tables with data, Customers, Employees, Managers, Manager_Employee. 

I was able to add manager name for the employees from the Manager_Employee table.
